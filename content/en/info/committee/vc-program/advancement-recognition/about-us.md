The district advancement committee implements procedures that help achieve BSA advancement procedures. The committee helps Cub Scout packs, Boy Scout troops, Varsity teams, and Venturing crews succeed. Units help youth members advance in rank. If they advance, they will have a good experience and will grow in their Scouting adventure.

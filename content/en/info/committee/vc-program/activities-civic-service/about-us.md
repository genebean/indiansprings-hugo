The district activities and civic service committeeâ€™s job is to provide mountaintop experiences that dramatically capture the attention of the whole Scouting community: a Scout color guard at a city hall ceremony, or presentation of the Award of Merit to leaders at a district recognition dinner. Your efforts help make these great events happen in the lives of Scouts and leaders.

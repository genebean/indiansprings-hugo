The district membership committee gathers information on prospective chartered organizations, helps organize new units, reorganizes dropped units and units not meeting, and recruits new members in a systematic way. It establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships with major community organizations and strategic alliances, both those with and without Scouting units. These include religious, educational, civic, fraternal, and veteran organizations and associations; labor unions; business and industry; professional societies; and other organizations with objectives compatible with the Boy Scouts of America.

The district nominating committee has the responsibility (as specified by local council bylaws) to select a slate of competent officers and district members at large. Proper election procedures are followed according to the bylaws.

The nominating committee is also a resource for recruiting additional district committee personnel. Collectively, the committee should have knowledge about the district, have extensive contacts in the community, and know where to locate the best prospective district officers and committee members.

## What we do

The District Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operations of our district.

## Who are we

__{{< district-role "district_chair" >}}__ is _your_ District Committee Chair. She is responsible for coordinating the activities of the various individuals and groups that make up our District Committee. The committee's work is divided among five groups:

- the [Communications]({{< ref "communications/about-us.md" >}}) team
- the [Nominating Committee]({{< ref "nominating/about-us.md" >}})
- the [Vice Chair of Finance]({{< ref "vc-finance/about-us.md" >}}) and their team
- the [Vice Chair of Membership]({{< ref "vc-membership/about-us.md" >}}) and their team
- the [Vice Chair of Program]({{< ref "vc-program/about-us.md" >}}) and their team

The structure of these teams are expanded a little on each of their respective pages linked above. Any position that doesn't have a name next to it is currently vacant... if you know of anyone who might be a good fit for such a role, please reach out to {{< district-role "district_chair" >}} or send us a message via our [contact page]({{< relref "/contact" >}}).

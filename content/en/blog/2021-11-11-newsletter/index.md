Hello everyone! This month we elected our district officers, saw Eagle projects completed, and got a brand new District Exectute... and a shooting sports field day!

## Field Day

So much fun was had at the Cub Scout Field Day - 45 Scouts from 3 different districts came out. As you can see from the pictures here, they got to learn and practive archery, bb guns, and slingshots.

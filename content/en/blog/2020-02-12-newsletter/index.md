## District Committee Meeting Notes

This month started off with formally voting on this year's committee members and was followed by committee reports and talking about each area that contributes to our JTE score card. Updated listings for both the District Committee and Commissioners have been added to the end of this month's newsletter.

**Program**: Georgia Deakin gave us an update on the upcoming Spring Camporee. This year's theme is disabilities awareness and most of that merit badge will be able to be earned as part of the event. Activities will include a cooking competition, a knot relay, a four-person tug-of-war, and more. The Camporee will be held out at [Clinton Nature Preserve](https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/view/departments/view_dept/&cdept=211&department=Clinton%20Nature%20Preserve) March 27-29 and will be a joint event with the Pickett's Mill district.

**Training**: Kyle Taylor let us know that last year we missed earning JTE Gold on the training portion by just two leaders being trained. He also reminded us that Youth Protection Training (YPT) certifications have started expiring for leaders who took the new program when it first came out. YPT is an essential part of being a leader in Scouting and, like all program safety certifications, must be renewed every two years. The latest version of YPT can be accessed on the BSA Learn Center via [my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org) to renew today! Additional trainings like Hazardous Weather also fit into the bucket of certifications that are expiring for a significant number of leaders this year.

**Communications**: Gene Liverman lead a discussion around how we communicate within the district. This included a discussion around having a formal way we distribute information instead of the hodgepodge of methods currently in use. Current thinking is that we want the district website (indianspringsbsa.org) to be the canonical source of info and that we want to use this newsletter as our way of getting the word out. We also discussed revamping our social media presence (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). More information about that will be shared as soon as we nail down a plan.

![OA Banner](OA-Banner.png)

**Order of the Arrow**: Larry Cohran updated us on membership levels within our OA chapter. He also mentioned that elections are happening now and that a lot of units have not yet scheduled elections. Now is the time for all troops, crews, and ships to schedule one.

In addition to the committee updates we discussed ways to get a wider variety of nominations for awards that recognize the service of leaders within our district in 2019 and what to do about rescheduling our District Awards Banquet.

![Banquet Table](Banquet-Table.jpg)

**Banquet**: The district awards banquet has been rescheduled for March 21st at 5:30pm. It will be held at Villa Rica High School this year.

The Indian Springs District of the Atlanta Area Council, Boy Scouts of America, is proud to announce that Jay Langley of Troop 39 has been awarded the American Radio Relay League’s Amateur Radio Service to Scouting Award. Established in 2013, the ARRL’s award recognizes actively involved Scouting leaders who make a significant contribution to providing Scouts with a memorable and valuable Amateur Radio experience. The award requires a candidate to meet five of ten available requirements, including organizing and teaching multiple Radio merit badge classes or multi-unit programs, leading district and council Jamboree on the Air events, and even serving on amateur radio staff at national jamborees.

Jay Langley, call sign N4NRL, is the Chartered Organization Representative for Troop 39 and Pack 239 at Bethany Christian Church. He has served two councils in a variety of volunteer roles, including district leadership. He holds a doctorate of Commissioner Science, is a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, and has received the District Award of Merit and the Silver Beaver Award. In his decades of Scouting, Dr. Langley has supported amateur radio programs for Scouts and volunteers of all ages with his knowledge, passion, and leadership.

## United Methodist Church and recharter

Multiple updates have been posted to [methodistscouter.org](https://methodistscouter.org) in the last couple of months, but a key point to note is this summed up well in this quote from February 23rd:

> **"Renewing Membership"** are the words that matter most right now. All Boy Scout units within United Methodist Churches should make sure their membership is renewed.

Please check the site for the latest news.

## Our new District Commissioner

Alisha Mason has taken over as our District Commissioner and is actively recruiting others to help the units in our district.

## New Eagle Scouts

Mike Handyside shared recently that there were 2 new Eagle Scouts in February! There are also 3 others working through the approval process right now.

Thank you to the leaders from Packs 138 and 1882 and from Troops 39, 228, 1228, 2819, and 144 (in Marietta) for attending ITOLS in February.

## Want to help a little or a lot?

We have many ways for anyone interested in helping the district to get involved. Opportunities range from time boxed commitments like helping coordinate events that happen once a year or assisting with a training session to roles that are active all year such as being a Unit Commissioner.

Two specific areas we could use some help with are:

1. a few administrative things related to camping
2. district finance and fund raising coordination

Reach out to us via [**our contact form**]({{< ref "/contact" >}}) if you'd like to get involved or know someone who might be interested.

Additionally, Kyle and Drew are always looking for help with training. Again, feel free to use [**our contact form**]({{< ref "/contact" >}}) or reach out to them directly if you are interested or know of someone who might be.

We will be hosting an in-person and virtual - simulcast - event to mark the kickoff of Fall Recruitment on Thursday, July 22nd.  Location and start time are TBD.  The event will provide resources for upcoming Fall Recruitment as well as an opportunity to have any questions answered by the Membership Team.  Here is a link to an extremely useful document that outlines many best practices as well as provides links to resource documents - flyers, calendars, parent orientation events, etc.

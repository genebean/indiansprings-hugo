## What we do

The District Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operations of our district.

## Who are we

__{{< district-role "district_chair" >}}__ is _your_ District Committee Chair. She is responsible for coordinating the activities of the various individuals and groups that make up our District Committee. The committee's work is divided among four groups:

- the [Nominating committee](nominating/)
- the [Vice Chair of Finance](vc-finance/) and their team
- the [Vice Chair of Membership](vc-membership/) and their team
- the [Vice Chair of Program](vc-program/) and their team

### District Committee organizational chart

Below is a chart that depicts the organization of our District Committee. You may notice that several positions say "vacant" next to them: these are all places where we could use your help either directly or via a suggestion of someone we could reach out to that might be interested in helping.

_Note: You may have to scroll a bit to see the chart. This is due to how large it is and is an unfortunate byproduct of the tool that creates the image. I have no idea why it feels it needs such a large amount of space above and below it._

To avoid some of the common issues that come with running a site like this, we require human-to-human interaction to get an account setup. Contact your committee chair or a webmaster to get your account created. When you go to log in the first time, you will be promoted for a code from an app that can be used for [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). [2FAS](https://2fas.com) has an app that will integrate with our site or you could use something independent like [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile). They both have apps for Android and iOS. If you don't have smart phone you are not out of luck - [1Password](https://1password.com/), a wonderful password manager, can do all you need. You are also welcome to use any other program that can generate a Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).

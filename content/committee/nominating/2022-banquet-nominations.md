Each year we hold a District Banquet and give out awards for the previous calendar year. Below is information about how nominations work, the available awards, and a form you can use to submit nominations.

## Nomination Process and Guidelines

Below are guidelines for the nomination process. All adult award nominations will be given equal consideration as long as the following guidelines are adhered to.

1. Anonymous submissions will NOT be considered. Even though submissions for the awards are typically kept confidential, any submission of a nomination for any award MUST be accompanied by the name of the person, or persons making the nomination submission. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2. Adult award nominations can ONLY be made by adults. Nominations for adult awards made by youth will not be considered. This is not meant to keep youth from having a voice in the process, so youth wishing to support a nomination must do so at the unit level with other adults.
3. Nominations should be made with regards to remarkable or outstanding service that goes beyond the normal duties of the adult volunteers. Also, for those who are submitting a nomination of someone for an award, PLEASE spend enough time to provide an honest and thorough justification for the nomination. All too often, people submit a nomination, but don’t put ANYTHING of substance in the write-up for the nominee, and those nominations quickly fall out of consideration as they are overshadowed by nominations with worthwhile write-ups.
4. Nominations submitted are voted upon by a specially select committee of 3 people who have no known ties to scouting at all. One person from each of the 3 counties in our district is asked to serve on this committee. Each year, the makeup of this committee is different from any of the previous years. The identity of the individuals of this committee are kept confidential, as is the date, time, and place they meet to consider the nominations. During the time this committee meets to review award nominations, there are NO other individuals permitted at the meeting place other than the 3 committee members themselves. This is done to provide the most impartial effort in determining the award winners possible.
5. Making numerous nominations for the same person for a particular award doesn’t improve their chances of winning the award. It’s all about the overall justification for the award. For units who have several people supporting a particular nomination, it is best that they all get together to work cooperatively on the single nomination justification write-up.
6. Godsend Award recipients must be selected by the unit. Nominations for this award made to the advancement committee are NOT accepted. It is recommended that the adults of the unit collectively select the recipient for this award, and that selection submitted on the "nomination" form on our district website by the unit committee chair, or their designee. Only one Godsend recipient may be named by a unit per year. NOTE: Each unit naming a Godsend Award recipient will be responsible for the $10 cost of producing the award supplies. The payment for this award must be made payable to the "Atlanta Area Council."
7. Hot Spark Award recipients are named in the same manner as are Godsend Award recipients. However, a unit can select as many Hot Spark Award recipients as they deem deserving.
8. ALL nominations must be focused on the award. Example: A nomination for Cubmaster must only contain nomination content that is focused on that person’s efforts in the role of Cubmaster, and NOT the extra work that individual may put in for the district or council.

## Unit Adult Awards

Please remember that there are no restrictions to units developing their own "in house" adult awards.  Such awards should be presented to your unit’s recipients at a unit ceremony, as opposed to the district awards event.  The following are district supported unit awards.

### Hot Spark Award

A recognition award for any adults, registered or otherwise, who have contributed important efforts to the unit’s program.  Contributions to be considered may include anything, no matter how seemingly small that the unit leaders deem worthy. Each unit may select as many recipients for this award as they wish each year.  Any person may be selected for this award as many times as the unit chooses, however, each individual receiving this award should only be selected to receive it once per year.  The selection for this award is to be for the recipient’s performance over the course of the current year under consideration, and NOT for each individual accomplishment that the recipient may have completed for the year.  The physical award for the "Hot Spark" is a token award fashioned as a match.  There is no cost to this award to the unit.

### Godsend Award

An award to recognize any adult recipient, registered or otherwise, for significant contributions to the unit’s program, success, and/or operations for the current year under consideration.  The unit committee must set forth the manner in which their individual unit selects their Godsend recipient. The district awards committee will ONLY accept the submission of the name of a recipient who has been selected by the unit.  The district awards selection committee will make NO selections from nominations for this award on behalf of the unit.  Recipients named for this award by an individual, either registered with the unit or not, will NOT be accepted.  The selection MUST be made by the unit committee. A unit may select ONLY one recipient for the Godsend Award per year, however, an individual may be named a unit’s recipient more than once.  The unit is responsible for the production cost of this award which includes a name plate and certificate suitable for framing.  The cost is $10.  The unit must make payment to the "Atlanta Area Council."

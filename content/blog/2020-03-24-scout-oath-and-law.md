These are challenging times in our country and the world.  As Scout Leaders, you have chosen to be part of a fellowship who's guiding principles are the Scout Oath and Scout Law.  Whether you are new to your unit or a long time Scouter, I would encourage everyone to practice these principles in your daily lives.  Check in with your unit families via text; better yet try a phone call.  Tom Godbold and the Commissioner team are already reaching out and offering their support and encouragement.

The Atlanta Area Council emails offer opportunities for at-home Scouting activities.  Sign up at https://www.atlantabsa.org/

This week we are challenging everyone to draw a picture of the American flag and place it in your window. Send us photos of your Scouts and their flags. Let's show the community that our Scouts care!

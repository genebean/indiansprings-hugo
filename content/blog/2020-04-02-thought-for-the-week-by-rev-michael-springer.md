Patience is the key, no matte​r what happens that makes you ​doubt, it can't change the​ fact that God is all powerful​. If you wait patiently long​ enough, you will see​ evidence of his power in your ​life. The Bible says: "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Rom. 8:38-39 *New King James Version*)

Whether you feel close to hi​m or not, you can be sure that ​he's always close to you.

--​​​Rev. Michael C. Springe​r

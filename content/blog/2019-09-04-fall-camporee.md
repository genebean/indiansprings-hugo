The 2019 Fall Camporee – Search and Rescue is **Friday Sept. 20 – Sunday Sept. 22**. This year we will be returning to the VFW. The last Camporee held here was tons of fun due to the lake access. We hope this year will be a repeat. We invite all Scouters out from the district to come and join us. Below are links to documents for this year's event.

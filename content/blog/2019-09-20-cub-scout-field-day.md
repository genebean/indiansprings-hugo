Saturday, Sept. 28, Villa Rica Elementary  
9:00am - 12:00pm
------------------------------------------------------------

This event will be a casual, drop-in activity open to all Cub Scout families. Come when you can, stay as long as you wish, and leave when you need to. The event is free.Â  The three activity areas will be open starting at 9am and will run during the event based on group size. Most activities will start to close down at 11:45am.

- For Tigers, Wolves, Bears, and Webelos, BB and archery ranges will be available as well as a special Bobcat experience area designed to help everyone get a head start on earning the first rank.
- Lions will have a special area just for them featuring a paper airplane range and Scouting game (sorry, but Lions can't participate in the other ranges due to safety guidelines).
- All Scouts must have adult supervision, and Lions and Tigers must have their adult partners with them during the entire event.

We encourage you to park in the lot on Peachtree Street beside the school. Activities will happen in the field behind the school. If you have additional questions, feel free to email Kyle Taylor at kyletaylor27@gmail.com.

Happy February everyone! Here's what happened during this month's District Committee meeting:

**Georgia Deakin on Program**: we have a new program chair at the council. Work on Day Camp is underway. Unfortunately, the Disabilities Awareness Camporee is not happening right away. The future date is sometime this fall.

Georgia is planning to do the short term camp administrator training this month via the online option. You can learn more and sign up for this at https://www.scouting.org/outdoor-programs/camping/short-term-camp/ Reach out to Georgia or Helen if you need help covering the $75 cost - we are happy to fund a few people getting this training.

## How's your unit handling the social distancing?

Troop 228 has been meeting, virtually, on a regular basis. Yes, at first, slow and awkward but our youth leadership is learning how the grown up business world of today wheels and deals. We are having about a 80-85% attendance rate with the virtual meetings thus far. A learning curve for sure, but what a wonderful opportunity to connect with one another and see our fellow Scouts. Troop 228 has held thus far, two troop meetings, 5 Board Of Reviews, 1 Scoutmaster Conference and two separate Patrol meetings. We are currently using Teams, a Microsoft platform that seems to work really well for our Scouts. It is a learning curve for sure for our scouts and some of us older adults!!! (I donâ€™t really like to use that word old! ðŸ˜‚)

Scouts are learning to use resources like [troopleader.scouting.org](https://troopleader.scouting.org) and yes troop meeting agendas to carry out their troop meetings. Games that are played normally at troop meetings are being played with family members. Our advancement continues with scouts meeting with ASMs, to get rank requirements signed off. We trust your unit is connecting as well and want to hear what you are doing to continue Scouting!!! I hope this message sparks some interest for your unit! It as a great day for Scouting! Stay safe and thank you for listening, Troop 228.

**Cub Scout Field** day has been rescheduled to this Saturday, October 23 at Bethany Christian Church. Those who were previously registered are good to show up on Saturday. Those who were not registered but would like to participate can just register on site. The program is running 1 - 5.

**Webelos Woods** is coming up on November 12 - 14 at Clinton Nature Preserve in conjunction with BALOO training. This special event is set up specifically to prepare Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts to cross over to Scouts BSA Troops when they are eligible. Troops are needed to help teach skills throughout the day and may camp for free, though they are responsible for their own food. This event also gives Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts the opportunity to see multiple troops in action. Not all troops are the same, and scouts sometimes need help finding the troop that best fits them. Registration is available at [atlantabsa.org/is](https://www.atlantabsa.org/is).

**Speaking of training**, please remember to keep your Youth Protection Training up to date as without it you will be dropped from your unit's roster. Please also take some time and knock out any position-specific training needed for the roles you are serving in. We currently have 108 untrained leaders within our district. On the bright side, there is a simple fix for almost any kind of training that you or your unit needs: reach out to Kyle Taylor or Drew Lyle and they will happily bring the training to you. It's a super easy and fast way to knock out training without spending lots of time behind a computer.

**And now for a celebration**: Vickie Brubaker has become the first female Eagle Scout in the Indian Springs District. Her Court of Honor was held on Sunday, October 17, 2021, and her Eagle Board of Review (which is the date of her Eagle Scout Award) was August 26, 2021.

Vickie was one of the first scouts to join when troop 1228 formed in February 2019. She was the first Senior Patrol Leader of the troop, and has served in many other leadership positions.  She was elected to Scouting’s National Honor Society, the Order of the Arrow, and now serves as our Chapter Chief. Vickie attended National Youth Leadership Training in December 2019, and then staffed the course in December 2020.

Vickie earned a total of 36 merit badges, 15 more than the required 21 on her trail to Eagle Scout, which means she earned three Eagle Palms.  She also earned the Camping National Outdoor Award, the World Conservation Award, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s 50th Anniversary Award.

On her trail to Eagle Scout, Vickie camped 46 nights, hiked 89 miles, and served her community for over 90 hours.  

Vickie’s Merit Badges:  Archery, Art, Basketry, Camping, Chess, Citizenship in the Community, Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Climbing, Communication, Cooking, Disabilities Awareness, Emergency Preparedness, Environmental Science, Family Life, Fingerprinting, First Aid, Forestry, Hiking, Horsemanship, Leatherwork, Moviemaking, Music, Nature, Personal Fitness, Personal Management, Photography, Pottery, Public Health, Reptile and Amphibian Study, Rifle, Sculpture, Shotgun, Small-Boat Sailing, Soil  and Water Conservation, and Wilderness Survival

Troop 1228 is chartered by Douglasville First United Methodist Church and Georgia Deakin is the Scoutmaster.

**The Annual District Business Meeting** is coming up soon - it is 7pm Thursday November 4th at Bethany Christian Church. Kent Lovvorn, our district Nominating Chair, said at the last committee meeting that we only have people for about 85% of the district's leadership positions. During the upcoming business meeting we will elect a new District Chair and Vice Chairs. One specific position we are still looking for someone to fill is Vice Chair of Finance. This person does not need to be a Scouter but could be a community leader or volunteer. Anyone who is active in the business community would be good to consider. If you have suggestions, please reach out.

That's all for this month. Here's hoping you are able to enjoy some of the nicer weather that is coming up and that you are able to enjoy some or all of the events coming up.

Happy August everyone! There's a lot to talk about this month so let's dive right in. First up: did you know we have a local Sea Scouts Ship (unit)? Not only is Ship 117 local, but they are offering the sailing merit badge on Saturdays between now and October at [VFW Post 7402 in Buchanan](https://goo.gl/maps/o3MehNNzJQHUTtFn8)! Check out [atlantabsa.org/ssactivities](https://www.atlantabsa.org/ssactivities) for dates, detials, and registration info.

Not already familiar with the Sea Scouts program? Have a look at the video below and [atlantabsa.org/seascouts](https://www.atlantabsa.org/seascouts) to learn about how they have been promoting better citizenship and improving membersâ€™ boating skills for over 100 years.

## United Methodist Church & Recharter

Next up is a quick note for any unit charted at a United Methodist Church: Steven Fitz, our district's Vice Chair-Membership and Religious Commissioner for the United Methodist Committee on Scouting, reported at our District Committee meeting that each will need to arrive at a decision which of 4 charter agreement options they want to utilize. He asked that each unit please reach out directly with questions as well for the most up to date information via [470-604-4120](tel:+14706044120) or [fitzsteven@yahoo.com](mailto:fitzsteven@yahoo.com).

## Eagle Projects

Mike Handyside, our district advancement chair, wanted to remind troops that it is important that Eagle Scout projects benefits the community; not an individual. If you or your unit have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## Training

![BALOO logo](/uploads/2022-08-baloo.jpeg)

Kyle Taylor, our resident guru of all things training, invites you to attend Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) training during Webelos Woods at Clinton Nature Preserve, October 22-23, 2022, starting at 8:30am on Saturday morning and concluding by noon on Sunday. This two-day, one-night course prepares leaders for many aspects of Cub Scout camping, including planning, programs, cooking, and camping techniques and equipment. **Every Cub Scout pack must have at least one volunteer who is BALOO trained in order to hold pack overnight camping events**, but having more than one BALOO trained leader is always a good idea.

Registration is $25 per person and is available through the council's Tentaroo registration system: https://www.atlantabsa.org/admin2/events/3843/25409/BALOO---Cub-Outdoor-Leader-Training. Please note that the deadline for registration is Wednesday, Octover 19th.

Be sure to check [the AAC calendar](https://www.atlantabsa.org/calendar/558/Training) for a complete list of training opportunties in our Council and remember that you can reach out to Kyle any time with questions or to request additional training opportunities.

Speaking of training - all volunteers should check to ensure their Youth Protection Training and Hazardous Weather Training are up-to-date. They must be renewed every two years or earlier! Go online to [my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org) to complete these courses and many others.

## Upcoming Activities

Now that everyone is all trained up, or at least well on their way to it, let's get to some more of our upcoming activities!

### Cub Shooting Sports Day

![Cub Shooting Sports Day flyer](/uploads/2022-08-cub-shooting-sports-day.png)

All existing Cub Scouts are encouraged to come out to Bethany Christian Church on August 27 from 1pm to 4pm for Cub Shooting Sports Day! You can earn your level 1 & 2 shooting sports awards and the cost is a whopping $0 - that's right, it is FREE!

### Even More Fun

In additon to the upcoming shooting sports day and the sailing days with Ship 117, we also have these events to look forward to:

* **September 16-18** - District Camporee @ Clinton Pioneering theme, watch for the flyer coming soon
* **October 21-23** - Webelos Woods @ Clinton
* **October 29** - Cub Field Day (new cubs)

Be sure to keep an eye out for more info on these and subscribe to our [district calendar]({{< relref "/calendar" >}}) too.

## A Day of Service

We are working to plan a day of service to be held in conjunction with Scouting's Birthday on February 8th. Douglas County Master Gardeners will work with Scouts and Carroll County will also have a project. More info will be shared as the plans are firmed up, but you are encouraged to go ahead and add the date to your calendars.

## Fall Recruiting

We have 11 dates set for fall recruiting at elementary schools within our district. Appointments will continue to be made and one buzz up has already been conducted. Yard signs promoting Cub sign up are available now by contacting Ramon Montgomery at [404-630-9998](tel:+14046309998).

## District Membership Chair Needed

We are looking for a willing adult Scout to temporarily fill the position of membership chair.  Reach out to Ramon, Helen, or [via our contact form]({{< relref "/contact" >}}) if you are interested or know somene who might be.

## District Committee Member Elections

Kent Lovvorn, our Nominating Committee Chair, wants to get the word out that in the next 30 days the committee will meet to discuss candidates for the upcoming election at our annual meeting on November 3. Committee members do not need to be registered Scouters to volunteer, nor do they have to assocaited with a unit (though they are most certainly welcome to be). Be thinking about who you know that has a skill set that could enhance our District team, even if it is for a limited scope of work.

## Georgia Master Natrualist via UGA Extension

Kevin Livingston from the UGA Cooperative Extension in Douglasville reached out and asked us to share the flyer below. Contact information for Kevin and the rest of the Douglas County UGA Extension Office can be found at [extension.uga.edu/county-offices/douglas/contact-us.html](https://extension.uga.edu/county-offices/douglas/contact-us.html).

![Fall 2022 Master Naturalist Flyer](/uploads/2022-08-Fall-Master-Naturalist-Flyer.png)

I know the registration date listed on the flyer passed before this newsletter went out, but since the course doesn't start until later this week I wanted to share it anyhow.

## Closing

Like I said at the opening, we've got a lot going on! I hope you find this newsletter useful and look forward to writing the next one. I welcome any and all feedback if you have ideas too, so please let me know if there is any way I could make it more beneficial. Lastly, if you'd like to get something your unit is doing promoted here, all you need to do is reach out [via our contact form]({{< relref "/contact" >}}) or come to our next District Committee meeting and tell us about it.

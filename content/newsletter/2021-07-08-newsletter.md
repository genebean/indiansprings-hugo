Happy July everyone! Here's what happened during this month's District Committee meeting:

We started with pledge, oath, and law by way of Zoom and this awesome video: [https://vimeo.com/432272336](https://vimeo.com/432272336).

Our first order of business was actually to celebrate Kyle Taylor's son earning his Eagle Scout!

## Andy Camp on recruiting and membership

- we are lacking a DE right now which poses some challenges for recruiting
- we have lost 6 or 7 units that did not recharter which means we are having to shuffle what schools are assigned where
- we have also identified several places that may be interested in starting new units
- 22nd is going to be a kickoff for recruiting instead of Round Table. It will be simulcast in person and Zoom. More information is available at [Indian Springs Fall Recruitment Kickoff Event](/blog/2021-07-13-fall-recruitment-kickoff/)

## Mike Handyside for Advancement

- we seem to be rolling along pretty good. This is a case of no news is good news.
- An Eagle board is happening in Douglasville.
- Best process for merit badge counselor is to use the online form and send it directly to Donna Horn and cc Mike

## Kyle Taylor on Training

- Training Report â€“ July 8, 2021
  - Overall Trained: 70.15%
  - District Staff Trained: 77.78
  - Overall District YPT: 98.30%
  - Number of YPT Expired Leaders: 4
  - Number of YPT Renewals for July: 1
- All expired people should have gotten multiple emails from both the BSA system and Kyle
- Council will be dropping people from roles very soon if they are expired
- As a reminder, you cannot participate in Scouting **in any way** if YPT is expired
- Drew and Kyle are available for in-person training for any unit. All you have to do is be open to others coming and provide a location.
- We are planning to do simulcast Roundtable too. More info to come
- **q from Mike**: units typically have an Eagle coach attached to their units and this is a trained position... is Roundtable a good place to do this training?
- **A from Kyle**: yes, perfectly appropriate and welcome.
